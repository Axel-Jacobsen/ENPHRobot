                <p>
                    Four Ewoks and Chewbacca are trapped in the Empire Stronghold! Our task was to create an autonomous robot to navigate the
                    stronghold and return the prisoners to the start of the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do this, we had to navigate over gaps, identify and react to alternating IR frequencies, climb a ramp, and deploy a basket
                    to return our captured critters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a diagram of the competition surface. It shows the positions of the Ewoks and Chewbacca, the gaps that we had to
                    cross, and the position and direction of the IR sensors.

                <p>
                    Our team took an unique approach to this challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To navigate to Ewoks, a RaspberryPi was running a machine learning algorithm called
                    <a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/">YOLO</a> to find their locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This RaspberryPi would send signals to a microcontroller (STM32F4) that was processing signals and making decisions. The
                    microcontroller would request directions to an Ewok when it was ready, allowing us to navigate purely
                    by finding Ewoks, and not by following tape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We chose a treaded robot in order to traverse the gaps. This let us roll over the gaps instead of taking time to deploy a
                    bridge that may be misplaced. Treads gave our robot reliability, as well as allowing us to focus on other
                    aspects of the competition.

                    The electrical circuitry of the robot was all integrated into a single printed circuitboard, which we designed ourselves
                    using Autodesk Eagle. Printing the circuit board allowed us to bundle up the "brains" of our robot in
                    a small volume able to fit between the two tracks, making our design compact, yet still robust. We blew
                    some traces powering our motors a few times. We also had to make the circuits we designed somewhat adaptable
                    on the circuit board, in case a design changed during the development of our robot. To do this, we used
                    common IC packages as much as possible, and kept them all at the same power and ground rails. Our single
                    circuit board was comprised of two h-bridge motor drivers; a switching voltage regulator and a couple
                    of resistors which were used to control all the servos in the robot (the basket and claw mechanisms);
                    another switching voltage regulator to power the STM32 F4 MCU and Raspberry Pi (which fitted into the
                    board as if it were a giant shield); a linear voltage regulator to provide a separate clean power supply
                    for the ICs; two rail-to-rail amplifiers which were used to amplify infrared signals for the MCU to process
                    digitally; and four opto-sensor comparator circuits which use infrared transmission and reflection to
                    detect edges and nearby obstacles; and another infrared beam which tripped when an ewok entered the claw
                    and alerted us to capture it. We were able to placate any potential noise issues by using a common ground
                    plane throughout the circuit board, placing a pair of decoupling capacitors at every IC, and by powering
                    the three main parts of the circuit board separately. The motor drivers and MCUs were powered by the
                    main battery. The servos were powered by another battery, and the ICs were powered by a separate battery.
                    Issues: some of the trace widths were too small, and blew when high current past through them (i.e. motors).
                    We also found that under harsh conditions (lifting the robot so there is no load on the motors when driven
                    fully) created ground transience which travelled back into the STM and fried it. To fix this issue, we
                    added a zener diode and capacitor in parallel on the input supply to prevent power spikes from frying
                    it. We also added parallel shocky diodes on the hbridge signals try isolate them. (edited) we can also
                    get diagrams of the circuits from eagle if we want to describe how each of them work individually

                    Vanessa performed well during testing, but had some difficulties during the competition. Due to the complexity of our approach,
                    we had difficulty integrating everything on time, and had to abandon our dream of a universal procedure
                    with no hard-coding in favor of a faster but less general strategy. We began our runs with a hardcoded
                    7 second drive using the encoders to keep Vanessa straight, before she began looking for Ewoks. Since
                    this maneuver was completely hard-coded, Vanessaâ€™s starting position had a large impact on her path up
                    the ramp. During the first run, she started too far left, and tracked off course, falling onto the PCB
                    between the tracks and breaking our main power connection. We managed to repair the wire in the 2 minutes
                    between rounds, but the first 3 attempts in round 2 had similar results, with Vanessa starting incorrectly
                    and driving off the course before the computer vision ever took over. On the final attempt of our second
                    run, she finally made it up the ramp far enough that the computer vision took over. From there, everything
                    worked perfectly. She tracked towards the first Ewok using the camera, crossed the 6 inch gap with no
                    issues, tracked towards the second Ewok, waited for the IR beacon, and proceeded through the gate without
                    triggering the alarm. Unfortunately, we hit our 2 minute time limit and had to stop before attempting
                    to rescue the third Ewok. Overall, the individual systems worked extremely well, but we underestimate
                    the amount of time needed to integrate and test the control system as a whole. If we had time to create
                    a universal control loop that relied only on the inputs of the various sensors and contained no hard-coded
                    procedures, I think we would have performed much better on competition day.
