## Developing

I am using [sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) which just makes your life so much easier. When developing, make sure you are running `https://sass-lang.com/guide` somewhere to compile the sass to css. Sass is pretty much the same as CSS but you can do nice things like nesting and using variables easily.
